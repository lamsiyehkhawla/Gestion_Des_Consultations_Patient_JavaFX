In this project, I developed a Consultation Management System using JavaFX and Scene Builder for the front-end, and MySQL for the back-end. The system follows the MVC (Model-View-Controller) architecture, ensuring a clean separation of concerns for better maintainability and scalability.

Key Features:
CRUD Operations: The application allows users to perform Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations on patient consultations efficiently.
Search Functionality: A search feature is implemented to allow users to quickly find consultations by patient name, date, or description.
MySQL Integration: The application connects to a MySQL database to store and retrieve consultation data, ensuring persistence across sessions.
JavaFX & Scene Builder: The front-end interface is designed using JavaFX and Scene Builder, offering a responsive and user-friendly experience.
MVC Architecture: The system is structured using the MVC approach, where the Model handles data, the View displays the UI, and the Controller manages user interactions, making the code modular and easy to maintain.
This application streamlines the process of managing patient consultations and offers a robust, scalable solution for healthcare professionals.
